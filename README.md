## Overview

This repository contains datasets and a dedicated result checker tool associated with the research paper *Data-driven university examination timetabling with consideration of student stress*. 

The datasets enable reproduction of the experimental results reported in the paper, and can also be used to explore alternative efficient solving methods for university examination timetabling problems. The integrated checker tool supports verification and quality analysis of generated timetabling solutions, facilitating rigorous evaluation of solution feasibility and optimality.

The repository is organized into the following three core components:

## 1. Checker

The `Checker` directory provides tools to validate timetabling solutions:
- `checker.py`: Core checking script to verify the feasibility of examination timetabling solutions and calculate objective function values.
- `data_list.csv`: Metadata table for all instances, including key parameters:

  | Column | Description                |
  |--------|----------------------------|
  | I      | Number of classrooms       |
  | S      | Number of students         |
  | M      | Number of courses          |
  | J      | Number of timeslots        |
  | R      | Number of regions          |
  | K      | Number of teachers         |

The `check_feasible` function in `checker.py` is the core validation method:
- **Input Parameters** (11 total):
  `I` (number of classrooms), `J` (number of timeslots), `M` (number of courses), `S` (number of students), `H_sm` (student-course matrix), `K` (number of teachers), `Q_km` (teacher-course matrix), `TK` (simultaneous examination course groups), `zjm` (timeslot assignment matrix), `pim` (classroom assignment matrix), `T_ir` (classroom region matrix).
- **Return Value**: Tuple `(feasible, val)`:
  - `feasible=True`: All constraints are satisfied, `val` is the calculated objective function value.
  - `feasible=False`: Some constraints are violated, `val` is a string describing specific violation reasons (for debugging).
- **Usage**: Run the script with the target test case name (e.g., `QX1`, `XY1`) as input.

## 2. Instances

The compressed file `Instances.zip` contains all experimental instance data (each subfolder corresponds to one instance). Each instance includes the following files:

| File Name | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `Classroom_campus_matrix.csv` | Campus affiliation of classrooms (1 = classroom belongs to the campus, 0 = otherwise; rows = classrooms, columns = campuses) |
| `Classroom_capacity.csv` | Capacity (maximum students) of each classroom (rows = classrooms) |
| `Classroom_region_matrix.csv` | Regional distribution of classrooms (1 = classroom located in the region, 0 = otherwise; rows = classrooms, columns = regions) |
| `course_campus_matrix.csv` | Campus offerings of courses (rows = courses, columns = campuses) |
| `Limit_invigilators.csv` | Number of invigilators available for each timeslot (rows = timeslots) |
| `same_time_teacher_course_matrix.csv` | Groups of courses that must be examined simultaneously (each row = one group) |
| `Student_course_matrix.csv` | Student-course registration relationship (rows = students, columns = courses) |
| `Teacher_course_matrix.csv` | Teacher-course responsibility relationship (rows = teachers, columns = courses) |

## 3. Solutions

The `Solutions` directory stores the solutions generated by the Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) algorithm proposed in the paper (one solution per instance). Each solution is split into two files:
- `out_{instance}_pim.csv`: Classroom assignment matrix (rows = classrooms, columns = courses; indicates which classroom is assigned to each course).
- `out_{instance}_zjm.csv`: Timeslot assignment matrix (rows = timeslots, columns = courses; indicates which timeslot is assigned to each course).
